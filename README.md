# Smart Intruder Detection System

## Project Overview
The Smart Intruder Detection System is a computer vision–based security application designed to detect unauthorized intrusions using image processing techniques. The system analyzes visual input and stores captured images to support basic security monitoring.

## Objectives
- Detect intruders using image-based analysis  
- Store and manage captured images for verification  
- Improve basic security monitoring through automation  

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- OpenCV  
- Image Processing  
- File Handling
